# ToDoUpdate
This is a class final project that me and my teammate worked on to demonstrate our understanding of object-oriented programming
... as well as our understanding the JavaFx API.
This consists of a simple To-Do list that allows the user to choose between 5 languages that they want the days on the
... program to be displayed in.
The program uses the information from the one stage and displays it on another stage. 
The displayed information is saved on text files for future reference.
However it allows the user to enter 3 lines of tasks per TextArea.
